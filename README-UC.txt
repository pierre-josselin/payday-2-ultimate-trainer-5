[SIZE="5"][B]Questions and answers[/B][/SIZE]

[B]The mod does not work.[/B]

Check the following :

[LIST]
[*]You have successfully installed SuperBLT (note you must also install [B]Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable package (x86)[/B]).
[*]You have deleted any previous version of Ultimate Trainer.
[*]You have placed the `UltimateTrainer5` folder (from the archive) in your `PAYDAY 2/mods` folder.
[*]You don't use a mod that skip the game intro and you don't use the "-skip_intro" command.
[/LIST]

[B]Can I get banned using this mod ?[/B]

PAYDAY 2 does not have Steam VAC, therefore you cannot be banned by using this mod.

However PAYDAY 2 has a basic anti cheat that detects some features. If you use them, you may be kicked from the lobby or have a CHEATER tag next to your name. This has no consequences and disappears automatically.

[B]Why do I start heists with only 30% of my health ?[/B]

This is due to the "Frenzy" skill of the "Fugitive" tree :
[QUOTE]Basic (4 pt): You only get 30% of your maximum health and cannot heal above it [...].[/QUOTE]
